            Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Maur√≠cio Mutte, a 21-year-old
            Frontend Software Engineer from Brazil.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for building innovative solutions led me to utilize
            programming as a tool to create new and exciting projects. I
            discovered my passion for programming at a young age and have since
            been able to apply my skills and knowledge to real projects for
            large companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working in teams and sharing what I know with others. That's
            why I created this blog to help people out and promote the "Learn In
            Public" concept. When I'm not coding (or contributing to open-source
            projects), I'm doing stuff like reading, listening to music, playing
            video games (FPS games are my favorite), or binge-watching TV shows.

          <CareerItem key={item.occupation} {...item} />
        ))}
